This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript: unhandled division by zero. The `bug.vbs` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version with error handling.  The error occurs because the script attempts to divide by zero without checking for this condition.  The solution implements error handling to prevent the script from crashing.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in VBScript to ensure application stability.
